Forum signature generator showing your rank in all four osu! gamemodes (global and country)!

It's run whitelist-only; this means that only the user IDs that you specify will have their stats generated.

You can also use the `banner` query argument to change the background. To add more banners, just add `400x80` images
into the folder `assets/banners`!

## Install

- Run the binary how you like
